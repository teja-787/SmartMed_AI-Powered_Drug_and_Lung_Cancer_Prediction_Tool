# SmartMed: AI-Powered Drug and Lung Cancer Prediction Tool

## 🔬 Project Overview

SmartMed is a machine learning-based medical decision support tool designed to predict:
- **Lung cancer likelihood** based on clinical features.
- **Patient drug response** using drug and patient data.

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making early diagnoses and selecting effective treatments.

## 🧠 Features
- Lung Cancer Prediction using ML models.
- Drug Response Prediction using patient drug data.
- Easy-to-use Streamlit interface.
- Real-time visualizations.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/models` – Pre-trained ML models (.pkl)
- `/app` – Streamlit app files
- `/data` – Sample datasets (replace with actual clinical data)
- `/images` – Visualizations and figures
- `SmartMed_Report_IEEE.pdf` – Project Report (IEEE Format)
- `SmartMed_Presentation.pptx` – Final Presentation
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies list

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for the frontend)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
